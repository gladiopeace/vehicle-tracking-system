=*Introduction*=

 
I am a 6th semester student on Birla Institute of Technology and Science – Pilani studying at Goa Campus, I am simultaneously working for my Master’s degree in Chemistry and Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering. 

I am interested in swarm robotics and embedded systems. A related field that interests me is Claytronics. It is about self-assembly of many modular robots to create synthetic reality. My recent work is centered on a new Wireless Sensor Network Platform and Mobile WSN. 

I will be trying to use the GPS ans GSM/GPRS modules to maka a vehicle tracking system.
